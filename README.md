Basically this project will help you understand with the image handling  

Previously i was using only MongoDB database for image handling i found it in-efficient

So i tried using supabase..I explored lots of features in supabase like authentication , storage and many more


So with the help of youtube..I made a small project related to image handling with supabase

Normal features:-  

1. SignUp / Login 

2. Upload images

3. Get images
